## Problem Statement:-
* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

* People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Solution:-
* By leveraging historical patient data (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG results, chest pain types), we developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. This predictive model assists medical practitioners in identifying high-risk patients earlier and more accurately.

## About Project:-
* Built a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease using key medical indicators such as chest pain type, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.
Improved early detection of heart disease by identifying high-risk individuals, aiding clinicians in making timely and data-driven treatment decisions.
* Achieved high accuracy in identifying at-risk patients, providing actionable insights for early intervention and treatment.
